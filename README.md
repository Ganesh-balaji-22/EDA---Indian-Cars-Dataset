# Indian Cars Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about various cars in India. The notebook covers essential statistical insights, data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations.

## Description

1. **Dataset Overview:**
   - Explore basic statistics of the dataset, including total observations, unique car makers, models, and the number of features.

2. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:**
   - Understand the initial steps taken to clean the data, handle missing values, and create a new 'car' column by combining 'Make' and 'Model'.

3. **Price Distribution Analysis:**
   - Examine the distribution of car prices through histograms on linear and logarithmic scales.

4. **Price Distribution by Fuel Type:**
   - Analyze the box plot of car prices categorized by fuel type to understand the price distribution within different fuel categories.

5. **Body Type Distribution Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of cars based on their body types through count plots and visualize the price distribution for each body type using box plots.

6. **Fuel Type Distribution Analysis:**
   - Understand the distribution of cars based on engine fuel types using a count plot.

7. **Power vs. Price Relationship:**
   - Investigate the relationship between car power and price using a scatter plot, with points colored based on the car's body type.

8. **Mileage vs. Price Relationship:**
   - Explore the impact of car mileage on prices through a joint plot with regression analysis.

9. **Correlation Matrix Heatmap:**
   - Visualize relationships between numerical variables using a heatmap of the correlation matrix.

10. **Multivariate Analysis:**
    - Explore relationships between displacement, mileage, power, and price through a pair plot and a 3D scatter plot.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in a compatible environment.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to understand the analysis process.
3. Refer to visualizations and insights to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

That's it, Thank you!
