# Exploratory Data Analysis of Indian Cars Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about various cars in India. The dataset includes details such as make, model, variant, body type, fuel type, and more.

## Dataset Statistics

The dataset statistics reveal key insights about the dataset:

- Total Observations: {l_D}
- Unique Car Makers: {c_m}
- Unique Car Models: {c_c}
- Number of Features: {n_f}

Let's visualize these statistics with a bar chart.

```python
# Visualization Code
```

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

We start by loading the dataset and performing some initial data cleaning and feature engineering steps. These include handling missing values, converting data types, and creating a new 'car' column by combining 'Make' and 'Model'.

```python
# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering Code
```

## Price Distribution Analysis

We examine the distribution of car prices in the dataset through a histogram. The data is visualized both on a linear and logarithmic scale to provide a comprehensive view of the price distribution.

```python
# Price Distribution Histogram Code
```

## Price Distribution Box Plot by Fuel Type

We analyze the box plot of car prices, categorized by fuel type, to understand the price distribution within different fuel categories.

```python
# Price Distribution Box Plot Code
```

## Body Type Distribution Analysis

We explore the distribution of cars based on their body types through a count plot. Additionally, a box plot is presented to visualize the price distribution for each body type.

```python
# Body Type Distribution Analysis Code
```

## Fuel Type Distribution Analysis

A count plot is used to illustrate the distribution of cars based on their engine fuel types. This provides insights into the prevalence of different fuel options in the dataset.

```python
# Fuel Type Distribution Analysis Code
```

## Power vs. Price Scatter Plot

We investigate the relationship between car power and price by creating a scatter plot. The points are colored based on the car's body type, providing additional insights into how power influences car prices.

```python
# Power vs. Price Scatter Plot Code
```

## Mileage vs. Price Regression Plot

A joint plot with regression analysis is used to explore the relationship between car mileage and price. This analysis provides insights into how mileage impacts car pricing.

```python
# Mileage vs. Price Regression Plot Code
```

## Correlation Matrix Heatmap

A heatmap of the correlation matrix is presented to visualize the relationships between numerical variables. This helps us understand how different features correlate with each other, offering insights into potential patterns within the dataset.

```python
# Correlation Matrix Heatmap Code
```

## Multivariate Analysis

A pair plot and a 3D scatter plot are created to perform multivariate analysis, exploring the relationships between displacement, mileage, power, and price. The points in the 3D scatter plot are colored based on the car's make, providing a detailed perspective on the dataset.

```python
# Multivariate Analysis Code
```

## Inferences and Conclusions

1. **Price Distribution Analysis:**
   - The histogram and box plot of car prices reveal a wide range of prices, with a majority of cars priced below $100,000. The logarithmic scale highlights the concentration of cars in lower price brackets.
